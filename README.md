| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| 06/03/20 | Started working on project! Invested time reading the requisites; about Minesweeper rules, variations and mathematical models around it.       | ~1.5 hs |
|          | Defined an initial approach to the solution: project will contain three components: a RESTful API, an API SDK (client) and a web app.          | ~1.5 hs |
|          | Defined a tech stack: API will use [Typescript](http://typescriptlang.org/) so I can take advantage of the stronger type system, will use      |         |
|          | [Express](https://expressjs.com/) as web framework, [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for logging, [React](https://reactjs.org/) |         |
|          | for the web app (and [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to scafold it). Based on requisites will         |         |
|          | most probably need to use a database, will come back later to that.                                                                            | ~1 hs   |
| 06/03/20 | Created a public git repo with the initial structure of the project, plus setup of gitignore, tsconfig, webpack file, etc.                     | ~2 hs   |
| 06/05/20 |                                                                                                                                                |         |
